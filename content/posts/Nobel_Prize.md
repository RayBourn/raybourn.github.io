Every year, the Nobel Foundation awards Nobel Prizes. It covers six fields:
physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, peace, and economics. It is regarded
as the most prestigious award in the world. The recipient, known as the
laureate, receives a green gold medal plated with 24-carat gold, a diploma, and
a monetary award of 11 million kronor (approx. 10.33 crore rupees).

The Nobel Prize in Physics is annually awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of
Sciences in Sweden. **This year, the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics is given
jointly to three scientists named John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M.
Martinis.**

**They discovered macroscopic quantum-mechanical tunneling and energy

To understand it, let us first understand what quantum mechanics is.

Every kind of matter in this universe is made up of atoms and light or energy.
When we go down to the scale of atoms or light particles, such as electrons or
photons, they behave differently and strangely. It is the foundation of quantum
mechanics.

So now what is quantum mechanical tunneling?

It usually happens when a particle or electron, passes through a barrier that is
supposed to be not possible to cross in the classical world. We can understand
it by assuming that a man is crossing a brick wall, which seems to be impossible
to us. Tunneling can happen not only to nearby particles but also to far-located
particles. This type of phenomenon is known as entanglement.

Nobel Prize-winning scientists built an electrical circuit with two
superconductors. These superconductors can pass electric current through them
without any electrical resistance. They separated these superconductors with
thin layers of materials that did not allow passing any current at all.

Here's what we suppose that no current will flow through the barrier. But they
managed to pass the electric current through the barrier. This is the
macroscopic version of quantum tunneling they discovered. They also managed to
discover that the energy doesn't flow continuously in the circuit but flows in
discrete amounts of energy or quanta. This process is known as the quantization
of energy.

This year, the Nobel Prize in Physics has provided opportunities for developing
the next generation of quantum technology, such as cryptography, quantum
computers and quantum sensors.
