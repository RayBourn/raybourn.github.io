It is the 31st day of dec 2025. A day that absorbs all the years’ happy and sad
moments. As usual, the last drip of night was dissolving into the dawn and I
felt my cortisol climbing up the hill. The world outside the window was muted
and wrapped in soupy fog and the air felt clammy under the murky weather. Life
seemed frozen in the moving world.

Life too seems silenced in the void before the cradle and after the death. In
between these events, we are bombarded with the colours of life.

In a milky soup of whites, the survival race begins for superiority to dominate
the darker world. Here life finds its distinctive gender role in the fourth week
of existence. The Y chromosome force arrives with a few gene sepoys to dominate
the X force, though in the fight for dominance, sometimes X wins.

A moment comes when the first glimpse of a ray illuminates the blurry piece of
life. It is the first time we come into this world. Everything seems blurry and
translucent to our eyes. In this alienated world, our first natural reaction is
to map the danger. Every moment seems dangerous. Every sound seems dangerous.
However a mother’s cradle absorbs all the dangerous, peculiar events and soothes
us. We look around curiously and now every moment captures our attention. Every
uncomfortable sound carves a pattern in our landscape of brain.

The colours of life tend to appear slowly and friends and family try to make
more sense of them. Every path of life seems adventurous. In this mazed world,
we try to set our distinctive path. Here every move is a source of learning. It
is sometimes unique, as mysteries try to befriend us.

Life’s colours appear with distinction. Books and friends try to erase the
obscured colours and clear the boundaries of shades. Colours become more vivid
and we tend to realise that true living is found in the vibrant colours of
friction. Our teenage dreams try to capture a single solid colour but as we
collect more colours of life, we realise that life does not move on a single
solid dye. It is a gradient that shifts from the purple bruise of heartbreaks to
the radiant golds of triumph.

We are defined by neon joys and sepia sorrows. Sometimes life lights up the grey
areas where we try to find the palette of colours. In youth, we paint primary
colours with bold strokes. but as we age, these primary colours splash and merge
to give the tints and shades of mature life. Finding an appropriate partner
makes us a kaleidoscopic version of ourselves and becoming a parent transforms
every year with a richer and deeper hue of wisdom.

But soon we realise that canvas we have painted so far is not retaining its
colours. We try to repaint it. but the crackling sound of bones and the
exhausting resources of body energy peel off the colours of life. We are now
wise enough to realise that colour doesn’t retain its pigments in this
illuminated world of vividness over a period of time.

As we age, the colours become monochromatic. Our coloured world comes under the
lens of grey shades. It becomes lacklusture. Now nothing is stark white and
nothing is pure black, everything falls under the experienced grey shades. Life
curls up and scoops all those tints and shades of experiences. The merging of
all colours in the spectrum gives a white bright flash. Then suddenly what
becomes?

Blackness. Void.
