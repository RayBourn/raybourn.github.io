Before opening my eyes, my hand was sliding across the bed under the command of
my lucid dreamy mind. My eyes were scrunched closed as they felt like a sudden
shock from the flashlight of fireworks.

The time is 5:30 a.m. Still 30 minutes are left before the alarm rings.

Darkness seems dull. Its contrast is dimming with the dawn of light. The
silhouettes of books make me wander in thought trying to remember where my
favourite book is resting. The dirt on the floor is finding its way under the
bed. My body is struggling to gather its energy. It feels like my mitochondrias
are in outrage after a short circuit. Finally i manage to sit on the bed. After
a constant struggle, my eyes are able to see the real world. My mind is
preparing for the day. Before the alarm rings, I switch it off. Before a ray
cracking through blurry window, I have to go for a walk. But my mind is
searching for something. Something that remained unfulfilled the previous day. A
hunger begins to rise that cannot be satiated for another days.

It is my phone. My mind is struggling to choose between getting up and entering
the real world or opening the luring virtual world while lying in comfort.
Within seconds the mind decides. Pick up the shoes and step into the real world.

But how does the mind decide not to feed a hunger built on a delicate glass
screen that can shatter any dream?

This is about social media, trends, validation, status, and virality. How our
mind gets addicted to useless enervation. Being have everything feels nothing.
This is how I overcame all of this. This is how I trained my subconscious mind.

It is the conscious mind, the subconscious mind and the mechanism between them
that control everything you do.

Your conscious mind is what you think of as “you”. It is the voice in your head
reading this right now. It carries your rational thought, your memory and your
focus.

Your conscious mind processes about 40 to 50 bits of information per second.
That is only about 0.0004% of what your senses receive right now. The rest goes
straight to your subconscious mind. Your conscious mind handles effortful,
complex tasks and life decisions. It is slow and limited in focus. Look around
you. What do you observe? Your focus is on a very narrow point. The rest is
processed in your subconscious mind. It processes around 11 million bits of
information per second. And that is massivaly insane. hmm…more than 99%.

Your subconscious mind controls everything effortlessly. It runs your heartbeat,
your breathing, your digestion, your immune system and every stored memory. It
executes every learned behaviour and every habit.

The subconscious mind is fast, automatic and active without your awareness. It
operates around seven seconds before you consciously make a decision. When you
think you are choosing, your subconscious has already decided.

When you pay conscious, effortful attention to a new task, it creates a pattern
and stores it in the subconscious. Anything you do for the first time forms a
new pattern. Your conscious mind pays full attention and it consumes a lot of
energy. That is why focusing feels exhausting.

> **_“As you sow in your subconscious mind, so shall you reap in your body and
> environment.”_**

When you do the same task again, your conscious mind directs the subconscious to
recognise the stored pattern. The subconscious then generates the emotional
response and performs the task automatically. This happens every day and every
second. Repetition strengthens the pattern, and it becomes a habit that works
without your awareness.

Every learned behaviour works this way. When you learn to ride a bike or drive a
car, you pay attention to every brake, accelerator, gear, and direction. It is
effortful for the conscious mind. But once the pattern becomes strong in the
subconscious, you drive effortlessly. Then you no longer think about the brake
or accelerator. Driving becomes automatic.

During childhood, a child pay conscious attention to surrounding environment.
They learn how to maneuver in mystical world. They learn how ridges appears to
understand expressions. This is why they watch curiously to feed the conscious
part of brain. New connections being carved in subconscious thing.

Using a phone is also a learned behaviour over the period of time. Paying
attention to reels, feeds, and posts strengthens the pattern in the
subconscious. Repeating it makes the pattern stronger. And eventually you use
your phone automatically. Furthermore you do not use it consciously. Scrolling
happens without awareness. It generates strong emotional responses. Excess
dopamine drains your peace and creates an anxious mind. Life then begins to feel
uninteresting.

The vivid virtual world makes the real world look dull. When you compare your
body to someone’s filtered curated image your conscious attention creates
anxious emotional patterns in your subconscious. You begin to feel unhappy.

You cannot unlearn the behaviour of using a phone. But you can consciously
choose what not to do. You must learn what social media is doing to you. You
must understand how it is harming you. Unless you pay attention to your own
behaviour, you cannot unlearn your bad habits.

> **_“Affirm the good, and the bad will vanish.” – Joseph Murphy_**

You can learn a new meaningful habit. It feels exhausting at first, but over
time it becomes natural. Exhaustion leads to fade your motivation within days.
You must be patient. Sachin Tendulkar did not get fame overnight. Einstein did
not create his famous equation in days. It took patience and effort invested
into something meaningful, something that looked dull to you. They trained their
minds to do that.

Consciously overtime i learned how the social media is grabbing my attention to
enervate. Realization is the biggest achievement to me. Scrolling the phone in
the morning does not make my life vivid. It only makes me anxious for the day
ahead. Mornings should be slow. That is why I choose not to scroll my phone
while still lying in bed. Still struggling but I choose the real world to regain
my focus and my attention.
