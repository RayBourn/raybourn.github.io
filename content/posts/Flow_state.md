No idea where to go. The air-raid siren was making shrieking sound. Soon there
would be Nazi planes overhead.

Like every kid, Mihaly had to find shelter. Soon he managed to find a place
where he saw hanging meat. He thought it was a butcher shop but quickly he found
hanging meat in wrong shape in the darkness. He carefully observed and found the
dead butchers hanging with metal hooks. He ran from there deep into the shop.
There he hid himself close to the dead bodies.

Mihaly was 6 years old when World War 2 broke out. He spent a lot of chilling
nights under the blankets during the war. His family lost everything. One of his
brothers had been killed in the fighting and another had been taken prisoner by
the Russians.

Mihaly was born in 1934 in Italy. His full name was Mihaly Robert
Csikszentmihalyi. During his childhood, he was put in an Italian prison. It was
the place where he found chess as a miraculous way to entertain himself. This
was the inkling idea.

When Mihaly was 15 years old, he was thrilled by the lecture of a legendary
Swiss psychologist, Carl Jung. He was amazed by the idea of looking at how the
human mind works. Then he decided to be a psychologist.

Over the period of time, he discovered that psychology was written with a very
limited view of human mind. There was something missing he was about to find. He
saw destruction in his life during the world war, but it was the time to see the
creation.

So, in Chicago, he followed the work of some artists and painters. He watched
one artist after another focusing on a single image. What he found that during
the time of creation, time seems still. He noticed when an artist completes an
image he doesn't feel overwhelmed but instead he focuses on another painting to
paint.

He found that creative people don't enjoy outcomes. They never intended to
prize. They feel pleasure in the process. Mihaly further studied the behaviour
of long-distance swimmers, rock climbers and chess players. These activities all
seemed to boring or physically uncomfortable to us. But they have some
similarities. After interviewing them he found that they are doing these
activities again and again. Reward is not important for them. They enjoy the
process. Mihaly called this process **‘Flow State’**. It is the state when we
feel painless in an activity and feel pleasure.

**It is the state when time, ego and external worries disappear.**

At that time nothing seems to important for us.

> _**“To overcome the anxieties and depressions of contemporary life,
> individuals must become independent of the social environment to the degree
> that they no longer respond exclusively in terms of its rewards and
> punishments. To achieve such autonomy, a person has to learn to provide
> rewards to herself. She has to develop the ability to find enjoyment and
> purpose regardless of external circumstances.” - Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi**_

Mihaly described some core components to achieve flow state.

- Person should have clear goals.
- They should know what they are doing and how they are doing it.
- They should choose a task which neither to be so easy, led to boredom nor
  challenging to induce anxiety.
- Activity should be meaningful.

His research revealed that people report in flow state at work often (54%) and
during leisure (18%).

Activities like painting, writing, programming or playing a musical instrument
frequently produce flow state. There are some other activities like gardening,
studying or learning new things, sports, hiking, cooking, designing, teaching,
etc. induce flow state.

Why?

**Because these activities are goal-oriented with clear feedback. They increase
as ability improves. They involve active-engagement not like watching TV or
scrolling reels. These create a sense of immersion.**

Mihaly shaped modern psychology with the search of meaning. To achieve deep
satisfaction, happiness and fulfillment in life, you don't have to require any
extraordinary talent or a necessary genius. You should work on flow state. You
should have clear goals. There should be a clear balance between challenges and
the ability to do tasks. Don't stress over external validation or rewards. Focus
on internal rewards. Mindful engagement with the task can give you a meaningful
and joyful life.
