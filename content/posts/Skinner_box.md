It was a time I remembered from 6th grade. I went to the school office to pick
up an attendance register with my friend. When I reached the office, our social
science teacher was talking to someone. No other soul seemed to catch my
attention in the room, but a strange device that was present near the ear held
my gaze.

this was the first time i looked a device... a small handy bar. This was a Nokia
1110 phone. It was a powerful device capable of transferring audio signals from
one place to another. One day our teacher gave the device to us to know how it
works, what is inside it, and what kind of features it has. We were curious to
watch its functioning but not capable of comprehending its potential. A
potential that was set to transform the near future.

Today, after 20 years, I have a device: not a Nokia 1110, but a so-called smart
device that has surpassed the human mind to some extent.

In this fast-changing world, mobile phones have become a necessary part of life:
the 207th bone of the human body. We use them not only on a regular basis but
also hourly.

Hmm... hourly basis!

It is not an old device whose purpose is to serve only two-way communication.
Billions of people are engaging with mobile devices to perceive reality through
the two-dimensional surface. Many apps have been designed to fill the
two-dimensional surface.

Developers create these apps to make our lives easier. Through apps, we can send
messages, write emails, scan documents, snap pictures, and create videos. Many
kinds of tasks can be automated through mobile phones. So voilà! We can now say
that smart device users have become smart users.

But wait, here is a catch.

Back in time, an American psychology professor at Harvard University was soon
going to change the trajectory of the future. This psychology professor's name
was B. F. Skinner. He conducted an experiment on animals. This experiment is the
most well-known experiment in psychology, what is known as "Skinner's Box."

To test this, he designed a simple yet ingenious device: a small, soundproof
wooden box with a lever, a food dispenser, and a light. He then placed a rat
into the box. A lever was hung to the side of the wall. A food tray was also
placed near the wall.

Here goal was simple. Whenever Rat would press the lever and a food pellet would
drop down in the tray, then Rat would eat the food pellet. Somehow Rat pressed
the lever, and eventually a food pellet arrived to eat. Over time, rat learned
the association of pressing the lever with getting food. This is the classical
example of positive reinforcement.

Skinner then varied the experiment to test different schedules of reinforcement.
He tested fixed ratio schedules and variable ratio schedules to test the
behavior of rat. He also introduced the negative reinforcement by adding a mild
shock to the box's floor, which rat could turn off by pressing the lever. He
conducted the experiment further with other stimuli such as tone, light, etc.

By countless trials, Skinner collected the data and analyzed it. What he
observed was that the behaviour of rat can be modified with rewards. Behaviour
was not random but followed a predictable pattern based on environmental
feedback. This was the groundbreaking discovery.

Its potential opened the window for a new world. Soon its implications were
going to change the world. Modification of rat's behaviour was going to modify
the human behaviour.

Sarcastically, Skinner's box becomes Sinner's box. Who took advantage of it?

Answer is simple. -Smart phone companies.

Now come back to our smart device: mobile phone. Humans are constantly using it
with their heads down. What companies learned from Skinner's experiment, they
applied to their apps. They developed well-known apps like Facebook, Twitter,
Instagram, and Snapchat. They leveraged them with rewards like red hearts. From
long-form content, they reduced it for short time. To grab attention, they
introduced ‘like’ and sharing feature. Thats are our food pellets.

People feel connected to each other, but in reality, they are more lonelier and
more depressed than ever. Dopaminergic rewards drain us completely. We are not
able to concentrate on one task. We are switching every time or even every
second. This form of tasking we embrace as multitasking. But evidence shows that
we are poor at multitasking. Companies are forcing us to be multitaskers by
reducing our attention span. Life seems dull in reality over saturated colors on
the screen. Constant comparison on the screen with others has made us more
anxious and stressed.

These all things are continuously altering our behaviour. We are using them over
and over. Just to seek validation or rewards, mobile phones are now become
Skinner’s Box and we become the rats of social media apps.
