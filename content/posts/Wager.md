One day, I was reading an article on medium. it takes less than a minute to make
me stumble upon a book that seems very interesting. I never read a genre like
this before. As i am living in a landlocked area far from the sea, it set me on
a seafaring reverie.

This story begins in secrecy and conflict. A man-of-war ship carrying 250 men on
board embarks from England in a squadron. This ship was on a mission to capture
a Spanish galleon. This ship was named **HMS Wager** and was set on a voyage in
September 1740.

Okay, so here first let me introduce some notable characters in this story.

David Cheap became captain of HMS Wager after a series of promotions. John
Bulkeley is a gunner on the Wager. John Byron is a midshipman. Robert Baynes is
a second-in-command lieutenant on the Wager.

There are also other characters, but now let's leave them for an in-depth story.

Captain Cheap will command the Wager. He is getting ready for the risky journey
around Cape Horn in January 1741. Cape Horn is a narrow passage below the map of
South America where two oceans, the Atlantic and Pacific, meet to create roaring
storms, winds, and rain. It is the most dangerous passage to cross.

During the passage, the huge storm battered the ship. Also, scurvy raged on the
ship. Men died in quick succession. In the midst of a furious storm, HMS Wager
fell behind and eventually lost the squadron. In May 1741, the ship struck rocks
and was wrecked off the desolate coast, now known as Wager Island in Patagonia.

On the landing coast, castaways tried to restore the contaminated flour and
other items. They were facing severe hunger. They built a large shelter to
provide warmth to their bodies. Some castaways departed from Captain Cheap’s
group. Due to limited food and Cheap’s insistence on naval hierarchy, robberies
were taking place, and eventually, conflicts arose among the castaways. Cheap
killed a man.

Captain Cheap is now a captive. He referred to his captors as “my mutineers." So
my mutineers culminate in the mutiny. Bulkeley leads a party to confront Cheap.
After 5 months of being shipwrecked, Bulkeley's party departed from the island
with 81 on board in three vessels, one named Speedwell.

Bulkeley arrived in Brazil in January 1742 with 29 surviving castaways out
of 81. After a few days, the Spanish captured them there and imprisoned them.

On the other side, Cheap’s party was facing severe hunger. They spent their 2
months after Bulkeley's departure. After an unsuccessful attempt, Captain Cheap,
along with 18 castaways, managed to reach Chiloé Island in June 1742.

In January 1743, Bulkeley arrived in England, where he published his survival
story to escape from court-martial.  After three years, in March 1746, Cheap,
along with Byron and Hamilton, returned to England.

All the survivors are summoned to court. The Court-Martial commences in
April 1746. In a pragmatic move, neither Cheap nor Bulkeley presses their main
charges. The judges focus only on the loss of the _Wager_ and ultimately absolve
all the men.

At the same time, the British Navy glorified Anson’s Centurian voyage. Anson
defeated the Spanish ship Covadonga and looted today’s 700 crore rupees' worth.
He returned to England in June 1744 after encircling the globe.

And finally, Wager’s mutiny… remains buried only on Wager Island. Wager’s story
is not a simple story, but it gives the harrowing nature of the rough sea. It is
the survival story of humankind.
