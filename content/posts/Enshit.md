It is 5 pm. Over the horizon, an orange gradient is filling the sky with
somewhat darker shades. The sky has bled out its last light, like a bruised
peach surrendering its sweetness. The rods in my eyes are working up for their
night shift, saying goodbye to the cones. My thoughts drift like fallen leaves.
Why?

Back to approx 16 years ago, I got my first glimpse of a mobile phone. It was
like holding a whisper from the future, cool and smooth in my palm. Navigating
the menus felt like deciphering an alien script. It was full of surprises.
Options were limited only to calls or messages. Once the pixelated glow of a
snake game screen gave us goosebumps, now we are thrown into a constant flood of
dopaminergic soup.

Where we once lacked a browser, we are now put into an infinite scroll abyss.
From the wired telephone to social media, the alteration of the brain is on a
par level. Open any social media app and you get continuous, unwanted feeds.
With the advent of AI, fake content looks so real that even our eyes can’t
detect what is reality.

But there is one trend affecting you more than social media and it is
**"Enshittification"**. It is not just ruining your social media, it is coming
for your living room, your wardrobe, and your wallet.

The term "Enshittification" was coined by the writer Cory Doctorow in
November 2022. It was also remain the Word of the Year for 2024. This term
describes how the digital platforms and services we love inevitably become
terrible over time. It is a specific decay pattern.

First we must understand how this works.

It functions in a three step cycle, also known as **"bait and switch".**

1. **Baiting the User (The Good Era):** At first the company looks useful. It
   gives you offers at very low prices. Or it could be free trial period. The
   company loses money on you. Why? To get you hooked. Simple as that.
2. **Baiting the Business Customers (The Abuse Era):** Once you are trapped, the
   platform changes the rules. They sell your data to other firms. Now your
   social media shows ads, ads from sellers, ads for sponsored items. Multiple
   ads show on other platforms. The experience becomes degraded over time.
3. **Taking Everything (The Greed Era):** Finally the customer is locked in. Now
   companies show more ads. They raise the fees or subscription costs of the
   platform. Your brain is hooked on that kind of service, while the company
   shows more ads for cheap products. Overall the quality of the product dips
   and things become expensive. This is "Enshittification".

> _**“Enshitification is what happens when growth matters more than
> goodness.”**_

But why don't we quit these abusive companies? Why don't we leave the platform?
Because your friends are on it. Or it could be the switching cost to move your
data from one platform to another, or the monopoly of a company forcing you to
stay. Whatever the reason, the customer is trapped now.

Take Google Search as an on-screen example. I once knew it as a good service
that gave you the best links for your search query. But now with the incoming of
AI, search quality has degraded. AI clutters the results without our will. We
don't know what we want to know because we are forced to obey algorithmic
calculations. Here not only is Google doing that but other companies are also in
the rat race.

As far as I know Flipkart, it is not like a shopping platform anymore, it looks
like an advertising company, like a ad house. Lots of ads are scattered all over
the sections in it. Amazon is also feeding its platform with cheap products.
Fake reviews and sponsored items have ruined the buying experience.

Platforms like instagram, snapchat, facebook or x are not far behind in
enshittification. I quit these platforms a long time ago and now I don't use
them. They are more addictive and time consuming. As far as I now know these
platforms are cluttered with AI generated content and recommendations, sponsored
ads and low quality cheap content designed to give you dopamine shots.

> _**“Dopamine is cheap, attention is expensive.**_

This kind of enshittification rules other online services too. However it is not
only digital services. Enshittification is also affecting real life services and
goods.

In India its effect is noticeable. India is the most populated country in the
world and feeding this country is challenging. The market is flooded with cheap
quality products. Fake products are on the rise. Adulteration happens all over
to satiate greed and hoard money. Sometimes I think what kind of world are we
living in which societal base is laid on capitalism.

In urban cities the cab experience or restaurant dining is increasingly plagued
by poor customer service. Hospitality grows but the provider is struggling to
keep the balance quality. Everybody is trying to cut their corners to maximize
profit and over time the customer’s experience and trust are eroding.

In electronics a "use and throw" policy is being adopted. The quality of
materials is downgraded to reap profit and the repair and replacement of parts
sometimes become nearly impossible.

In the fashion industry India is adopting a **"fast fashion"** model of
low-quality cheap clothes. Here cloth quality remains for only five or six
washings, afterwards the customer lurks for another items. Customers are
flooding their wardrobes with trendy clothes which is further causing
environmental impact. Uhh.. Microfibers you know. Concerning truth. That is why
I buy fewer clothes.

Finally enshittification is not just about an app getting worse. It is a
**"pattern of decline"** where consumers are treated merely as sources of short
term profit rather than human beings.
